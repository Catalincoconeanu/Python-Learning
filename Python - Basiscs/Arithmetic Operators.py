# Arithmetic Operators
# For multiplication we use *
# To divide we use /
# % percent
age1 = 12
age2 = 15

sum = age1 + age2

# Sample of operations with strings

sent1 = " Today is ok"
sent2 = "Tomorrow is not ok"

# Another sample:

firstName = "Cata"
lastName = "Coconeanu"

firstName + lastName
# Will return Cata Coconeanu

# We cant substract a string from a string, but we can multiply a string with an integer

i = "Hello"
i * 10
# This will return Hello 10 times

# We can select based strings based on Index

sentence = "Cata is programming!"
sentence[0]  # This will return the first character of the string > "C"

# To select a specific range of characters:
sentence[0:3] # This will return the string "Cata"

# To select from the last character of the strings to the firs ones

sentence[:-1]  # This will select the last character of the string
