# If , else, elif statements

if (5>3):
    print("Hello Word")
# This will print Hello Word

if (5<3):
    print("It is")
else:
    print("Is not")

# This will print Is not

# Comparations:
# 3 >= 2   - greater or equal
# 3 <= 2   - less o equal
# 3 == 3   - equal
# we cant use the " = " because is used to assign a value, we must use 3 == 2

# Exercise1:

age = 16
if age < 13:
    print("You are young")
elif age >= 13  and age < 18:
else:
    print("You are an adult")

# Exercise2:
if 5 >3 and 2 > 1:
    print("Hello")
# If both are true the Hello is printed

# Exercise3:

if 5 > 3 or 2 > 1:
    print("Hi")
# If any of the statements are true the Hi message is printed
