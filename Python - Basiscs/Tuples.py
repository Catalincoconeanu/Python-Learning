# Tuples is a data structure, you cannot change, update, delete items in a tuple, it uses normal paratesis

tulp1 = ("orange", "apples", "bannanas")

# We cannot modify the items, but we can access the values

tup[1]     # Will return apples, the corresponding index

# As lists we can put multiple tuples

tup3 =  tup1 + tup2

# We can also see the lenght

len(tup3)
