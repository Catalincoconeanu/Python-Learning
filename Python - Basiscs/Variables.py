#Variables are memory locations to stores values
age = 30
#We assigned the value 30 to variable "age"
#Other Examples:

sample =  "My name is Cata!"

#We can also use multiple assigment

sarah, bob, mike = 16,21,17

#A good practice will be to assign:

sarah = bob = mike = 17

#this way we assigned 17 to sarah, bob and mike
#or

name,age = "Cata", 30

#We assign the string with " " and the value as integer
