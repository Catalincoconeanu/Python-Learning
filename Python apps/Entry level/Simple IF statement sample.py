#Simple if statment sample, the execution of the code will end at the first block of code because 5 < 10 = TRUE and then will print the last part, if we change the nr to something bigger then 10 then the second block of code will run.
x = 5
if x < 10:
    print("5 is smaller then 10.")
if x > 10:
    print("5 seems to be bigger then 10.")
print("App ends here!")
